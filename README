Xapian TREC harness
===================

This was written by Andy MacFarlane at City University back in 2003 or so.

I've tweaked it to build, but not tested it as I don't have access to
TREC data.

Its use of the Xapian API could do with some updating as it was written
before the creation of Xapian::TermGenerator.
